The total coins shown in the Switcheo wallet balance often does not match the amount in the NEO wallet.  Sometimes it syncs with time, sometimes it does not.   Yesterday the Neo wallet showed a lower amount of GAS, today it showed the correct number of Gas while  on both days the Switcheo screen for the attached neo wallet balance as incorrect. I have screenshots but not sure where to upload.
